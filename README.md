Introduction to Lethals Project
============

This document was created as a repository of the scripts used in the analyses of the article: XXXXXX (doi: XXXXX).
Files used in the pipeline are described as follow
- *sim.slim* Forward in time simulations were conducted using the software [SLiM 3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30517680/)<sup>1</sup>.
- *demographic_inference.py* This python script contains the code used for the inference demographic parameters using the software [dadi](https://dadi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#welcome-to-dadi)<sup>2</sup>.
- *selection_inference.py* This python script contains the code used for the inference of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) using the software [fitdadi](https://github.com/LohmuellerLab/fitdadi)<sup>3</sup>.
